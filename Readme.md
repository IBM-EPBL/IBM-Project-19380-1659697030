##PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

During the COVID 19 crisis, the need for plasma increased, while the number of donors has
decreased. Plasma is necessary for the survival of people with cancer, rare disorders,
immunological problems, and genetic anomalies. Every blood bank claims to be out of
blood, so we need to make people aware of the issue and offer support. Numerous camps,
seminars, and applications can be of great help.
